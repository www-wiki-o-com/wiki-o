Hello,

You ({{ email }}) have been invited to test and join Wiki-O. We are currently testing our alpha version of the software and so we appologize if things don't work as intended or worse the site crashes. But, if it does crash please record the url of the crash and either email us or post a bug report in our forums (user feedback).

Thanks again. Follow this link {{ invite_url }} to join now.
