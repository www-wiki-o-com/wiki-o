      <p>Statements must be composed without implication. For example the
        statement "Anyone with a brain can see that Trump is a genius" implies
        that the statement is true. It should instead be composed as "Trump is
        a genius".</p>

      <p>The false statement must be the logical complement and must not make
        any additional implications. For example the statement "Trump is
        stupid" is not the compliment of "Trump is a genius", "Trump is not a
        genius" is the complement.</p>
