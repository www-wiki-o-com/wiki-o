            The total points are calculated by adding up the individual columns.
            However, if the points are forced then they remain constant. Forcing
            the total decouples the true points from the false points and the
            calculated points now conform to the forced ratio.

            Form an opinion on the sub-theories first. That way if you believe the
            opposite of what is stated, the text will reflect that.
            <br><br />
            Additionally, the distribution (ratio) of points assigned to the
            sub-theory will be re-calculated to reflect the formed opinion. To
            override this feature, enable the force option.
