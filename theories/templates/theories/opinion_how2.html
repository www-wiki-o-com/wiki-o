          Points are relative. Assign the same value of points to two statements

          Total Points

        <div class="card card-body">
          The total points are calculated by adding up the individual columns.
          However, if the points are forced then they remain constant. Forcing
          the total decouples the true points from the false points and the
          calculated points now conform to the forced ratio.

          Form an opinion on the sub-theories first. That way if you believe the
          opposite of what is stated, the text will reflect that.
          <br><br/>
          Additionally, the distribution (ratio) of points assigned to the
          sub-theory will be re-calculated to reflect the formed opinion. To
          override this feature, enable the force option.
