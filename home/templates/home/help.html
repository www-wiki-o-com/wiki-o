        <div class="card-body mx-4">
          <p style="margin-bottom:0.5ex;"><b><big>Theories</big></big></b> are
            used to describe possible states of reality such as <i>"The earth is
            flat"</i>. At Wiki-O, all theories are welcome and encouraged.
            However, the following guidelines must be followed for Wiki-O to be
            effective. We will continue with <i>"The earth is flat"</i> as our
            running example.</p>
          <ul style="margin-left:2ex; margin-right:6ex">
            <li> Title statements should be unique and concise. </li>
            <li> The true statement should capture the theory or state that is
                 being described. True statements should not include the word
                 "not". </li>
            <li> The false title should not make any additional claims such as
                 <strike>"The earth is round"</strike>, instead the statement
                 should be <i>"The earth is not flat"</i>. </li>
            <li> Refrain from constructing leading statements such as <i>"The
                 earth is obviously flat"</i>. </li>
            <li> The details should not include collaborating or contradictory
                 evidence, instead that should be provided as separate
                 contributions. For example, a picture of the earth would be
                 evidence not a detail of the theory. </li>
          </ul>

          <p style="margin-bottom:0.5ex;"><b><big> Evidence </big></b> is data
            that is used to collaborate or contradict the theory. Verifiable
            evidence, otherwise a fact, is data that anyone with enough
            resources can verify. For example the following statement is
            verifiable <i>"One can complete a loop by travelling in a straight
            line on the earth's surface."</i> and this one is not <i> "Bill,
            from Reddit, seen the edge of the earth." </i>. Use the following
            guidelines to construct well formed evidence.</p>
          <ul style="margin-left:2ex; margin-right:6ex">
            <li> Title statements should be unique and concise. </li>
            <li> The details should not include additional claims or biased
                 remarks. </li>
            <li> The verifiable flag is not determined by consensus. </li>
            <li> Non-verifiable evidence may be demoted to a sub-theory if
                 people wish to form an opinion on it. </li>

          <p>This section describes how content violations are resolved. To
            allow for a quick processing of violations any Level 3 user can
            resolve the conflict. Any Level 3 user can also reverse the decision
            or call for a vote. In the event of a vote, Level 3 users and above
            have 10 days to cast their vote. At the end of the 10 days, the vote
            is tallied and the decision is fortified. Level 4 users may
            prematurely end a vote or reverse a decision. Level 3 users cannot
            reverse a Level 4 decision. The following table documents some of
            the possible outcomes of a violation:</p>

          <p>If a decision is rejected, then the <b>rejection counts as a strike

            strikes against the user triggers a demotion in user
            permissions.</p>

          <p>This section describes how user promotions and demotions are
            implemented to happen automatically. Aside from the automatic
            process, the staff at Wiki-O reserves the right to make broad
            decisions about a user's access level.</p>
          
          <p style="margin-left:4ex; margin-bottom:0.5ex;"><b
            style="margin-left:-4ex">Strikes:</b> There are three ways a user can
            receive a strike:</p>
          <ol style="margin-left:2ex; margin-right:6ex;">
            <li> The user was reported for a content violation and the violation was accepted. </li>
            <li> The user reported a content violation and the violation was rejected. </li>
            <li> The user requested an action that was denied. </li>
          </ol>
          <p> Only strikes within the last 100 days count against the user. A
            new strike against the user will trigger an <b>automatic
            demotion</b> if the user has had 3 or more strikes (including this
            strike) within the last 100 days. Additionally, If a user gets
            demoted from a specific access level three times, then they are
            <b>banned</b> from that level for life.</p>

          <p style="margin-left:4ex"><b style="margin-left:-4ex">Level 0:</b>
            Only Level 4 users can promote a Level 0 user to Level 1. In other
            words, a Level 0 status is more or less permanent.</p>

            Only Level 4 users can promote Level 3 users. In other words, Level
