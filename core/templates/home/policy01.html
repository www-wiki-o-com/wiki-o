          use of your <i>personal information</i> and how you can access and update
          this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of
          companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do

        <div class="card-body text-justify">
          <p> Here at Wiki-O our goal is to collect user demographics and
          opinions, which includes tracking changes to this data over time. To
          this end, we will store any and all information that you knowingly
          provide us when you create an account, publish content, and form
          opinions. To create an account we require your email address and
          username. If you do not want to provide us with a valid email, then
          you will not be permitted to create an account. In addition to your
          email and username you are welcome to provide or omit other personal
          details about yourself such as your location, religion and so on. </p>

          <p> In addition to personal data, Wiki-O collects theories and evidence
          for users to form an opinion on. To maintain the integrity of this
          data, we track user contributions and changes to this database. </p>

          When you visit wiki-o.com our servers automatically record
          information that your browser sends. This data may include information
          such as your device's IP address, browser type and version, operating
          system type and version, language preferences or the webpage you were
          visiting before you came to our website, pages of our website that you
          visit, the time spent on those pages, information you search for on
          our website, access times and dates, and other statistics.

        <div class="card-body text-justify">
          <p> You are able to access, add to, update and delete certain personal
          information about yourself and your opinions. The information you can
          view, update, and delete may change as the website changes. When you
          update your information, however, we may maintain a copy of the
          unrevised information in our records. </p>
          
          <p> Here at Wiki-O we feel that opinions and how they change over time
          are fascinating. Additionally, the correlation between different
          opinions and different demographics is highly valuable scientific
          information. That is why we retain all user data entered into our
          service and to prevent users from trying to game the system we retain
          the user's email. The deleted opinions and profiles are used for
          data aggregation and are not directly view-able by the public. </p>

        <div class="card-body text-justify">
          <p> Any of the information we collect from you may be used to
          personalize your experience; improve our website; run and operate our
          website and services. Non-<i>personal information</i> collected is used only
          to identify potential cases of abuse and establish statistical
          information regarding website usage. This statistical information is
          not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would identify any
          particular user of the system. </p>

          <p> We may process <i>personal information</i> related to you if one of the
          following applies: (i) You have given consent for one or more
          specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may be allowed
          to process information until you object to such processing (by opting
          out), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following
          legal bases below. This, however, does not apply, whenever the
          processing of <i>personal information</i> is subject to European data
          protection law; (ii) Provision of information is necessary for the
          performance of an agreement with you and/or for any pre-contractual
          obligations thereof; (ii) Processing is necessary for compliance with
          a legal obligation to which you are subject; (iv) Processing is
          related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the
          exercise of official authority vested in us; (v) Processing is
          necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us
          or by a third party. In any case, we will be happy to clarify the
          specific legal basis that applies to the processing, and in particular
          whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
          requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract. </p>

        <div class="card-body text-justify">
          Depending on your location, data transfers may involve transferring
          and storing your information in a country other than your own. You are
          entitled to learn about the legal basis of information transfers to a
          country outside the European Union or to any international
          organization governed by public international law or set up by two or
          more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken
          by us to safeguard your information. If any such transfer takes place,
          you can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this

        <div class="card-body text-justify">
          You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed
          by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you
          have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given
          your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the
          right to object to the processing of your information if the
          processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii)
          you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us,
          obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and
          obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have
          the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to
          be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain
          circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in
          which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other
          than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances,
          to obtain the erasure of your <i>personal information</i> from us; (vii) you
          have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly
          used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have
          it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This
          provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by
          automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a
          contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations
          thereof.

          the exercise of an official authority vested in us or for the purposes
          of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
          processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation
          to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your
          <i>personal information</i> be processed for direct marketing purposes, you
          can object to that processing at any time without providing any
          justification. To learn, whether we are processing Personal

          submit any <i>personal information</i> through our Website or Service. We
          encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's
          Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their
          children never to provide <i>personal information</i> through our Website or
          Service without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a
          child under the age of 13 has provided <i>personal information</i> to us
          through our Website or Service, please contact us. You must also be at
          least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personal
          data in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or

          Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
          websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
          tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information
          in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
          collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use
          or visit a website or online service as they move across different
          websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal
          is not yet uniform. As a result, this Website is not yet set up to
          interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your
          browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy,
          we limit our use and collection of your <i>personal information</i>.
