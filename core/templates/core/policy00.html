          You are able to access, add to, update and delete certain Personal
          Information about you. The information you can view, update, and
          delete may change as the Website or Services change. When you update
          information, however, we may maintain a copy of the unrevised
          information in our records. Some information may remain in our private
          records after your deletion of such information from your account. We
          will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our
          legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. We
          may use any aggregated data derived from or incorporating your
          Personal Information after you update or delete it, but not in a
          manner that would identify you personally. Once the retention period
          expires, Personal Information shall be deleted. Therefore, the right
          to access, the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the
          right to data portability cannot be enforced after the expiration of
          the retention period.

             information is not otherwise aggregated in such a way that would
             identify any particular user of the system.</p>

          <p>We may process Personal Information related to you if one of the
             following applies: (i) You have given their consent for one or more
             specific purposes. Note that under some legislations we may be
             allowed to process information until you object to such processing
             (by opting out), without having to rely on consent or any other of
             the following legal bases below. This, however, does not apply,
             whenever the processing of Personal Information is subject to
             European data protection law; (ii) Provision of information is
             necessary for the performance of an agreement with you and/or for
             any pre-contractual obligations thereof; (ii) Processing is
             necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which you are
             subject; (iv) Processing is related to a task that is carried out
             in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority
             vested in us; (v) Processing is necessary for the purposes of the
             legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party. In any
             case, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis that
             applies to the processing, and in particular whether the provision
             of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a
             requirement necessary to enter into a contract.</p>

          You may exercise certain rights regarding your information processed
          by us. In particular, you have the right to do the following: (i) you
          have the right to withdraw consent where you have previously given
          your consent to the processing of your information; (ii) you have the
          right to object to the processing of your information if the
          processing is carried out on a legal basis other than consent; (iii)
          you have the right to learn if information is being processed by us,
          obtain disclosure regarding certain aspects of the processing and
          obtain a copy of the information undergoing processing; (iv) you have
          the right to verify the accuracy of your information and ask for it to
          be updated or corrected; (v) you have the right, under certain
          circumstances, to restrict the processing of your information, in
          which case, we will not process your information for any purpose other
          than storing it; (vi) you have the right, under certain circumstances,
          to obtain the erasure of your Personal Information from us; (vii) you
          have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly
          used and machine readable format and, if technically feasible, to have
          it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This
          provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by
          automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a
          contract which you are part of or on pre-contractual obligations
          thereof.

          of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such
          processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation
          to justify the objection. You must know that, however, should your
          Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you
          can object to that processing at any time without providing any
          justification. To learn, whether we are processing Personal

          Some browsers incorporate a Do Not Track feature that signals to
          websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
          tracked. Tracking is not the same as using or collecting information
          in connection with a website. For these purposes, tracking refers to
          collecting personally identifiable information from consumers who use
          or visit a website or online service as they move across different
          websites over time. How browsers communicate the Do Not Track signal
          is not yet uniform. As a result, this Website is not yet set up to
          interpret or respond to Do Not Track signals communicated by your
          browser. Even so, as described in more detail throughout this Policy,
          we limit our use and collection of your personal information.
